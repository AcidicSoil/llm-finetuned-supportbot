			"taskTitle": "Add Hyperparameter Sweeps and Early Stopping",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded with 4 subtasks. To regenerate them, use the following prompt: 'Expand the task 'Add Hyperparameter Sweeps and Early Stopping'. The goal is to integrate Optuna for hyperparameter sweeps and use the Hugging Face Trainer's EarlyStoppingCallback. The expansion should cover adding the callback, creating a sweep runner script, defining the search space in a configuration file, and documenting the new functionality.'",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is high (7/10) due to the integration of a major new library (Optuna), the creation of a new execution workflow (sweep runner), and modifications to the configuration system to support search spaces. The existing 4 subtasks are comprehensive and logically structured, so no further expansion is needed."

			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Create Lightweight Model Registry",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create Lightweight Model Registry'. The implementation should be file-based, storing JSON metadata for each run in a `registry/` directory. The subtasks should cover defining the metadata schema, creating a utility function to write the registry entry, integrating this into the post-evaluation step of the training pipeline, and creating a simple script to read and display registry contents.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is low (3/10) as it primarily involves file I/O and collecting existing data at the end of a pipeline, without requiring a database or separate service. Expansion into 4 subtasks is recommended to ensure a structured approach: defining the data contract (schema), encapsulating the write logic, integrating it into the existing workflow, and providing a basic utility for consumption."

			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Prompt Templating System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded with 5 subtasks. To regenerate them, use the following prompt: 'Expand the task 'Implement Prompt Templating System'. The system should use Jinja2 to apply templates to user input before inference. The expansion should cover adding the dependency, creating a directory with example template files, building a core utility function to render templates, and integrating this functionality into both the command-line demo and the FastAPI API endpoint.'",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium (5/10) because it introduces a new dependency (Jinja2) and requires modifying multiple user-facing components (CLI, API) and adding a new shared utility. This requires careful integration to ensure consistency. The existing 5 subtasks are well-defined and cover the entire implementation lifecycle, so no further expansion is necessary."

		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Add Optional Guardrail Hooks",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Add Optional Guardrail Hooks'. The goal is to create a system for pre-processing inputs and post-processing model outputs to filter content. The subtasks should cover designing a common interface for guardrail functions, integrating hook execution points into the main inference pipeline, implementing at least one example guardrail (e.g., keyword-based filter), and adding configuration to enable or disable guardrails.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium-low (4/10). While a simple implementation is trivial, creating a robust and extensible hook system requires thoughtful design of the interface and configuration. Recommending 4 subtasks ensures that the design, integration, implementation of an example, and configuration are all addressed as separate, manageable steps."

		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Create Dockerfile for API Service",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create Dockerfile for API Service'. The goal is to create a production-ready, multi-stage Dockerfile for the FastAPI application. The subtasks should cover the initial Dockerfile creation with a build stage for dependencies and a lean final stage, creating a `.dockerignore` file to optimize the build context, adding a `docker-compose.yml` for simplified local execution, and documenting the build/run process.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is medium (6/10) because creating a production-quality Dockerfile involves best practices beyond basic commands, such as multi-stage builds for smaller images, layer caching, handling large model artifacts efficiently, and security. The recommended 4 subtasks break this down into creating the core file, optimizing the build, providing developer-friendly tooling, and documentation."
