# Task ID: 25
# Title: Create Lightweight Model Registry
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a simple file-based model registry to track experiments and artifacts.
# Details:
Create a top-level `registry/` directory. After each successful evaluation, write a metadata JSON file to this directory containing the run ID, metrics, and path to the packaged model artifacts.

# Test Strategy:
Run a full train-and-eval pipeline. Verify that a new metadata file is created in the `registry/` directory with the correct information.
