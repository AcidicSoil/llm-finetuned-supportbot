# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Results Exporter and Summary Table
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Save detailed evaluation results to a file and print a summary table to the console.
# Details:
The evaluation script should output detailed per-question results to a CSV or JSON file in the `results/` directory. It should also print a formatted summary table to the console showing win rate, hallucination rate, and other key metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Run the evaluation script and check that a correctly formatted CSV/JSON file is created in `results/` and that a summary table is printed to standard output.
