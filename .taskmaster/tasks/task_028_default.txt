# Task ID: 28
# Title: Create Dockerfile for API Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Package the FastAPI application and its dependencies into a Docker image for deployment.
# Details:
Write a multi-stage `Dockerfile`. The first stage installs dependencies. The final stage copies the application code and model artifacts, exposing the API port. The entrypoint should run `uvicorn`.

# Test Strategy:
Build the Docker image using `docker build`. Run the container and test the `/healthz` and `/generate` endpoints from the host machine.
