# Task ID: 27
# Title: Add Optional Guardrail Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement hooks to check for and filter unsafe or out-of-scope queries and responses.
# Details:
In the inference logic, add an optional pre-processing hook for input queries and a post-processing hook for model responses. These hooks can apply simple checks like regex or keyword matching.

# Test Strategy:
Enable a guardrail that blocks a specific keyword. Send a request containing that keyword to the API and verify that it is rejected or handled appropriately.
