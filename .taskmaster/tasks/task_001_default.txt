# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure, virtual environment, and core dependencies.
# Details:
Create the repository structure including directories like `src/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `eval/`, `results/`, `tests/`, and `api/`. Initialize a uv project with `pyproject.toml` declaring runtime dependencies (`transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, `trl`, `accelerate`, `bitsandbytes`, `torch`) and a `dev` dependency group containing `pytest`.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the directory structure is created, `pyproject.toml` exists, and `uv sync --dev` completes successfully.
