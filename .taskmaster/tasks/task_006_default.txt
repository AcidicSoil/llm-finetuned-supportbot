# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Master Data Preparation Script
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Orchestrate the entire data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline with a single command.
# Details:
Create `scripts/prepare_data.py` that takes input/output paths as arguments. This script will call the parsers, validator, splitter, and tokenizer in sequence to generate the final processed datasets.

# Test Strategy:
Run the script with sample raw data and verify that the final processed and tokenized `train`, `val`, and `test` datasets are created in the specified output directory.
