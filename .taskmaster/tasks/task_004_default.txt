# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Stratified Train/Val/Test Splitting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a script to split the unified dataset into training, validation, and test sets to prevent data leakage.
# Details:
The splitting logic should be deterministic and allow for stratification based on metadata fields like `source` or `tags` to ensure balanced representation across splits.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the script produces distinct train, validation, and test files. Check the distribution of stratified keys across the splits to ensure it's balanced.
