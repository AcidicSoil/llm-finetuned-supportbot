# Task ID: 17
# Title: Write Smoke Tests for Training and Inference
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Create fast-running tests to ensure the main training and inference paths are not broken.
# Details:
Create a `tests/smoke` directory. The training smoke test should run for a single step on a tiny dataset. The inference smoke test should load a model and generate one response.

# Test Strategy:
Run the smoke tests as part of the main test suite. They should complete in under 60 seconds and pass.
