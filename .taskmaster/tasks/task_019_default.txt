# Task ID: 19
# Title: Add Configurable Training Recipes (SFT/DPO)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the training script to support different training objectives like DPO.
# Details:
Refactor the training script to allow selection of a trainer (e.g., `SFTTrainer`, `DPOTrainer` from TRL) via the YAML configuration. This requires adapting the data format for preference data.

# Test Strategy:
Run a short training job using a new `dpo.yaml` config and verify it uses the `DPOTrainer`.
