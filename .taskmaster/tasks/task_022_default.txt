# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Advanced Input Length Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add strategies for handling inputs that are longer than the model's context window.
# Details:
Implement an optional sliding-window strategy for long contexts as an alternative to simple truncation. This can be configured in the data processing step.

# Test Strategy:
Process a document longer than the max sequence length and verify that the sliding window approach generates multiple overlapping chunks.
