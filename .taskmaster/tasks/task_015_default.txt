# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Model Packaging Utility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a utility to save the trained model artifacts for deployment.
# Details:
The utility should save the LoRA adapter weights, the tokenizer configuration, and any other necessary model config files in the standard Hugging Face format. Create a corresponding simple loader function.

# Test Strategy:
Package a trained model. Then, use the loader utility in a separate script (like the demo or API) to load the packaged artifacts and confirm it can perform inference.
