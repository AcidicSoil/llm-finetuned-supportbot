# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Best Model Selection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automatically save the best model checkpoint based on a specified evaluation metric.
# Details:
Configure the Hugging Face `Trainer` with `load_best_model_at_end=True` and specify `metric_for_best_model` (e.g., 'eval_loss' or a custom win-rate metric).

# Test Strategy:
Run a training and evaluation job. Verify that the final saved checkpoint corresponds to the epoch with the best score on the specified evaluation metric.
