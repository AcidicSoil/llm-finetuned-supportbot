# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Automated Metrics Calculation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Calculate win-rate and hallucination rate based on the evaluation harness outputs.
# Details:
For side-by-side comparison, implement a win-rate test (can be manual review initially or use a stronger LLM as a judge). Create a stub for a rubric-based hallucination scoring system. The script should aggregate these scores.

# Test Strategy:
Provide sample model outputs to the metric script and verify that it calculates and aggregates the scores correctly.
