# Task ID: 23
# Title: Add Mixed-Precision and Gradient Accumulation Presets
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Provide pre-configured settings for common performance optimization techniques.
# Details:
Add options to the training config (YAML) to easily enable/disable mixed-precision (`fp16`/`bf16`) and set the number of gradient accumulation steps.

# Test Strategy:
Run training with `gradient_accumulation_steps=4` and verify from the logs that the effective batch size is 4x the per-device batch size.
