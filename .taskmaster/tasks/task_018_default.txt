# Task ID: 18
# Title: Setup Basic CI Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure a continuous integration pipeline to run checks on code changes.
# Details:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow (or similar) that triggers on push/pull_request. The pipeline should install dependencies, run linters/style checkers (e.g., ruff), and execute the `pytest` suite including unit and smoke tests.

# Test Strategy:
Push a commit or open a pull request and verify that the CI pipeline runs and passes successfully.
