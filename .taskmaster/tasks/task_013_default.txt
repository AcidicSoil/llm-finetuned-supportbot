# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Interactive CLI Demo
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a simple command-line interface for quick Q&A with the fine-tuned model.
# Details:
Create `demo.py` that loads a trained model and enters a loop, prompting the user for a question and printing the model's generated answer.

# Test Strategy:
Run `uv run demo.py`, enter a question, and verify that the model generates a response. Ensure a clean exit path exists.
