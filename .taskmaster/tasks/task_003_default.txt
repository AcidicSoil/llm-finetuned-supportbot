# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Data Parsers for Various Sources
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create parsers to load support dialogs, tickets, and Q&A data from different formats into the unified schema.
# Details:
Develop modular parser functions within the `src/` directory, each responsible for a specific data source (e.g., JSON, CSV). Each parser should output a list of objects conforming to the defined data schema.

# Test Strategy:
Test each parser with sample input files and assert that the output is correctly structured and validated by the schema validator.
