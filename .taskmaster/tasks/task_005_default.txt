# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Data Tokenization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert the preprocessed text data into tokenized format suitable for the model.
# Details:
Use the tokenizer from the chosen base model (via `transformers` library). The process should handle padding and truncation of sequences up to `max_seq_length`.

# Test Strategy:
Tokenize a sample batch of data and inspect the output `input_ids` and `attention_mask` to ensure they have the correct shape and format.
