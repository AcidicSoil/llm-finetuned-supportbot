# Task ID: 24
# Title: Add Hyperparameter Sweeps and Early Stopping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Integrate logic for hyperparameter optimization and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
# Details:
Integrate with a library like Optuna or Ray Tune for sweeping LoRA rank/alpha. Implement early stopping callback in the `Trainer` to halt training if the validation metric stops improving.

# Test Strategy:
Configure an early stopping callback with `patience=2`. Run a training job where the validation loss plateaus and verify that training stops early.
