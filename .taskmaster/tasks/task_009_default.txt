# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Checkpoint Saving and Resuming
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable saving model checkpoints during training and resuming training from a saved checkpoint.
# Details:
Configure the `Trainer` to save checkpoints periodically. Implement logic in the training script (`scripts/train.py`) to handle a `--resume-from-checkpoint` argument.

# Test Strategy:
Start a training run, stop it after one epoch, then resume it from the saved checkpoint. Verify that the training continues from the correct step/epoch.
