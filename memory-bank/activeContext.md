# Active Context

Current focus:
- Initialize Cline Memory Bank and Rules/Workflows for repeatable planning.
- Align tasks with `PRD.txt` using the parse-PRD workflow.

Next steps (short-term):
- Ensure training/eval scripts are runnable end-to-end.
- Capture evaluation results under `results/` and summarize.

Notes for Cline:
- Read all files in `memory-bank/` at task start.
- After milestones (e.g., training run completed), update `progress.md` and this file.
