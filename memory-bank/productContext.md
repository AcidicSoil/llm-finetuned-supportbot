# Product Context

Users:

- ML-curious developers and portfolio reviewers who want a concise, reproducible example of LLM fine-tuning for support workflows.

Problems:

- Base models answer generically and may hallucinate on product-specific support queries.
- Need a low-cost pattern to adapt a small model with transparent tradeoffs.

Use cases:

- Evaluate if LoRA-tuned small models can reliably handle FAQ/troubleshooting prompts.
- Provide a demo CLI/API for quick before/after comparisons.

Non-goals:

- Full customer support platform, ticket routing, or analytics.
