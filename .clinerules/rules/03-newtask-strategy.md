# Cline Rules â€” New Task Strategy

- Use `/newtask` to start a clean thread when scope shifts or context grows large; include a short handoff summary.
- Use `/smol` (or `/compact`) to compress long conversations before continuing work.
- Prefer small, verifiable steps; rely on checkpoints to compare and restore if needed.
- Ask for confirmation before destructive actions (e.g., deleting files, large refactors).
