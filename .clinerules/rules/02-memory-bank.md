# Cline Rules â€” Memory Bank

- Always read all files under `memory-bank/` at task start.
- After completing a milestone or making design changes, update:
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (what we're focused on now)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (milestones/changelog)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (architecture decisions/tradeoffs)
- Keep entries concise and decision-oriented; avoid noise.
